## Overview

SanpVite is a social event-sharing platform that allows users to create, share, and manage events seamlessly with their friends or the public. Unlike traditional social media, where people share personal stories, SanpVite focuses on event-based interactions. Users can maintain public or private profiles, follow the other user and accept thier following invitations. The user invite its friends to events by sharing a "story", and track RSVPs in real time. The Smart RSVP System enables attendees to confirm their participation with options like "Attending," "Maybe," or "Interested," while hosts receive live updates and can send reminders.

According the user input the owner(s) of the event can see the apporeved guest list. Users can also see the list of events they accept to attend. Additionally, the platform features Event Polls & Suggestions, enabling attendees to vote on event details such as time, location, or menu preferences. By blending social engagement with event management, SanpVite simplifies planning while enhancing the overall experience for both hosts and guests.
